<h3>The Prestige</h3>
<p>Just Phenomenal. You'll never guess the major twist behind two magicians.</p>
<h3>Life is Beautiful</h3>
<p>Indeed Life is beautiful. Think positive, you'll not be regretted.</p>
<h3>The Apartment</h3>
<p>
  Absolutely brilliant. The way it represents everything (film-wise), it was
  great. Everything about The Apartment is a standout for sure theory-wise,
  cinematography-wise, direction-wise. You know why I'm using "wise" right?
  Loved every second of it and the concepts.

<h3>Memories of Murder</h3>
<p>Best Korean Thriller !!!!!!</p>
<h3>It's a Wonderful Life</h3>
<p>
  It's a miracle to just be alive, something most people take for granted. This
  movie makes you understand the importance of human life and how very important
  we all are.
